How do I approach designing software?
- I approach designing software by taking in inventory of what is needed for the software.  Once noted I create road maps on how I will approach the goals needed to complete the software.
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
-It gave me a new perspective on how to approach a new task.  OpenGL was brand new to me and it has a very interesting dynamic and learning curve to master.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
-My process was to tackle one step at a time.  To focus on one specific part of the project and move on to the next.  
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
-They can be applied by looking at future projects from a different perspective.

How do I approach developing programs?
- My approach to developing programs is discovering all the details and requriments that are needed and/or expected of the program.  What's its purpose?  How should you look? Etc.  Once I have gathered all the information I need.  Then I can start developing the program.
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
- Breaking down the tasks into smaller more manageable tasks.  Allowing me to focus on one step at a time, giving me more focus on the tasks at hand.
How did iteration factor into your development?
- Iteration that factored in my developent was, the repetition of code.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
- At first it was simply to understand and see for myself what the code would do.  After some experimention, I soon got the hang of how it all worked.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
-It can help me by broading my horizon on what is avaible out there for me.  Giving me more knowledege and problem solving skills that can be implemented in day to day life.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
-Developing problem-solving skills by applying computational techniques to real-world problems, enhancing my analytical and critical thinking abilities.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
